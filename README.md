# Toontown Stride
 September build of Toontown Stride - open sourced and free to use.

##Tired of waiting for keys?
Great news! Toontown Stride is now available to the public on Github!

##Are we allowed to use this in any projects?
Yes, you can! No need to worry! The official Toontown Stride team welcomes you to **build off any files listed inside the repository after you clone.**

##Why do this?
Since Toontown Stride was originally meant to be a community-based server, we decided to make it *truly* community based on behalf of the original contributers to the source.

##Is this version safe?
Feel free to scan yourself and give us feedback on your findings!

##A lot of this code looks stolen, why is this?
When Stride started, it was started by a team of hackers that decided it would be fun to take code from Toontown Rewritten, Toontown Infinite, and Toontown House with the claim of new features and community-based tweaks in order to reel people in- the plan was to get people to join Toontown Stride and plant a honeypot within the game and/or launcher. This build is guaranteed to be virus-free and is safe to use amongst anyone out there willing to try this version of Stride, as it's no different then the current version that's out there. The features this version DOESNT have are:
*The rushed Paint Shop*
*The new pick a room screen*
*a few deletions of important code that cause the current build to be unstable to release*

###Credit goes to Mr. Batty and Alexalexer for this build of the source.
